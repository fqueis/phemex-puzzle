base58_decode('ETH') = b0 c8. If you take that number as big endian, that means it's just like regular decimal numbers, i.e. 
the leftmost byte is the highest one.
So converting to decimal gives 
0xb0 * 256 + 0xc8 = (11*16) * 256 + (12*16+8) = 45256

Little endian is just the other way around, you would "start low and get higher":

0xb0 + 0xc8 * 256 =  (11*16) + (12*16+8) * 256 = 51376

In essence: to convert a multiple-byte word between big and little endian, just reverse the bytes
